    <!-- Abstract -->
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Safety specifications in cyber-physical systems (CPS) capture the operational
      conditions that the system shall satisfy to operate safely within its intended
      environment. As environmental conditions evolve, operational rules that express
      acceptance criteria must be continuously refined to preserve alignment with
      observed system behavior. These rules, often expressed as logical or quantitative
      constraints on system behavior, are validated through simulation-based testing
      but may become inconsistent as new operational conditions or boundary behaviors
      emerge. We ask: Can grammar-constrained refinement loop using large language models
      (LLMs) automatically refine inconsistent operational rules while preserving
      syntactic correctness and semantic validity, and what safety concerns emerge from
      language-in-the-loop refinement? We introduce a framework that combines
      counterfactual reasoning with a grammar-constrained refinement loop to refine
      operational rules, aligning them with the observed system behavior. Applied to an
      autonomous driving control system, our grammar-constrained refinement loop,
      supported by counterfactual evidence, successfully resolved the inconsistencies
      in an operational rule inferred by a conventional baseline while remaining
      grammar compliant. An empirical LLM variant study further revealed model dependent
      refinement quality and safety lessons, which motivate parser-based grammar
      enforcement, stronger automated validation and broader evaluation in future work.

      We introduce a grammar-constrained rule refinement framework that leverages
      counterfactual reasoning combined with grammar-constrained LLMs to produce
      interpretable, syntactically and semantically valid refinements of operational
      rules.

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      An initial study on an autonomous driving subsystem showed that our loop
      eliminates inconsistencies produced by the selected conventional method.
      An LLM variant study further exposed model dependent quality and safety trade-offs
      including syntactic violations and over-constraining operational rule refinements
      that risk overfitting to the test data. Future work will strengthen grammar
      enforcement, semantic validation, and evaluation breadth.
